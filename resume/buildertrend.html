					<li><h3>Who am I?</h3>
						<p>These days, I like to call myself a developer, but that wasn't always the case. Having done lots of dirty jobs in the past, from pouring concrete in the summers to building roofs in the midst of frigid South Dakota ice rains, I've learned just how important it is to have the tools, teamwork, and information you need to get things done well and make it home in time for dinner.....
						</p></li>
					<li><h3>What I do..</h3>
						<p> Well, you see, I have a lot to learn, but thats not something thats going to stop me from growing and becoming a valuable team member no matter where I go.

			<h2> My Work</h2>
			<h3 class="underline_text"> Film Streams Student Night Application</h3>
			<p> Updated a data & attendance tracking application for the Film Streams' organization to include additional data and functionality, including the ability to clean and modify information and export information into different formats. Added functionality to allow the application to effectively work for multiple locations upon the opening of Film Streams second location, and provided views for new types of data.</p>
